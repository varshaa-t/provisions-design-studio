                        We believe in a collaborative approach! We start with a kickoff 
                        meeting to understand your brand, vision, and goals for the 
                        website. You'll be involved every step of the way â€“ from initial 
                        design concepts to development and launch. We'll keep you in the loop 
                        and ensure you approve everything before we move forward.
